# spaceinvaders

A Simple Space Invaders Game in Java.

A Long time ago it was one of the first programs that I made in my Java (2003 or 2004), At that time I followed a tutorial, 
If I remember well there was a site explaining all the steps to develop this game and others, I have many others.

In this one specifically at that moment I followed a the codification step by step, and I used the image of the tutorial in the folder sprites, when I finished and it work I used even the comments of the tutorial, however believe me I did it work 
without coping it, just in the end I did it.

I tried to find the tutorial I used in Internet, however I coulnd't, I wanted to congratulate him, if I remember well 
it was made in version 1.3 of Java :-)

There are plenty of this game code on internet today in every language I could imagine.

Found it lost here.
